# FAQs or What can I do with the VM?

## Who can I contact?

If you experience problems, please do not hesistate to write a mail to Roland Kluge (roland[D}kluge[A}es[D}tu-darmstadt[D}de).

## Where should I start?

1. Navigate to the Desktop (*Win+D*)
2. Double-click *Eclipse Neon 1.a*
3. All material is contained in the workspace that opens up.

## Where is the metamodel? Where are the Topology Control rules?

1. In Eclipse, open the project *de.tudarmstadt.maki.tc.cbctc.specification*
2. Double-click the EAP file *de.tudarmstadt.maki.cbctc.specification.eap*
3. Enterprise Architect Lite opens up.
3. The metamodel can be found in the package *de.tudarmstadt.maki.tc.cbctc.model*. 
The Topology Control rules of kTC (and a number of other TC algorithms) can be found in the package *de.tudarmstadt.maki.tc.cbctc.algorithms*.

## How can I run a sample simulation?

1. In eclipse, open the project *simonstrator-simrunner*
2. Navigate to *config/rkluge/launch/"
3. Right-click *GUIRunner-with-EMF.launch* and select *Run as -> GUIRunner-with-EMF*
4. Type the file name *jvlc_complete_evaluation.xml* into the search bar.
 * This file contains all parameters of the simulation (e.g., energy model, movement model, protocol stack, overlay application).
5. Press *Start Simulation*
6. Two windows should pop up
 * The *Topology Visualization* window shows the current output WiFi topology 
 * The *Simulation* window shows statistics about the progress of the simulation, simulation speed, etc.
7. Additionally, the log output in the *Console* view of Eclipse provides information about the progress of topology control.

## What do the log messages tell me?
The *Console* view of Eclipse reports on Topology-Control-specific metrics.
An example:

**Explanation:**
* ```iter##001``` Denotes the first iteration of the Topology Control algorithm. In this setup, Topology Control is executed periodically every 10min of simulated time.
* ```iter#001 CEs... Adding node Node [...]``` Before running the algorithm, all pending context events are handled.
* ```iter#001 CEs   Done (t=247ms, t_check=7ms, violation=0,...``` At the end of context event handling, the required CPU time for the handling and for the constraint checking is printed. Additionally, the number of detected constraint violations is reported.
* ```iter#001 iTC...(algo=D_KTC(id=1), parameters=Parameters: {a=2.0, coneCount=4.0, k=1.41})``` Then, incremental the topology control algorithm is invoked (here: the traditional kTC with k=1.41). Afterwards, the required CPU time for the algorithm and the constraint checking are printed.
* ```iter#001 bTC...(algo=D_KTC(id=1), parameters=Parameters: {a=2.0, coneCount=4.0, k=1.41})``` For comparison reasons, the batch counterpart of the current algorithm is executed on a copy of the topology and runtime statistics are printed.
* ```iter#001 iTC vs. bTC (CE+TC) wrt. [time=4.98 / LSMs=1.00]``` At the end of a Topology Control run, the costs of the incremental and batch algorithm are compared in terms of CPU time and link state modifications. In this case, the incremental algorithm needed ca. 5 times longer compare to the batch algorithm. The link state modification count is identical in this iteration because the topology is processed for the first time.

# Concerning the research questions

Unfortunately, the SHARE VM is not powerful enough to reproduce the full evaluation, however you can get an idea of the how the results were produced.

* *RQ1-Correctness* After handling context events and invoking Topology Control, the per-algorithm constraints are checked and violations are reported (see ```violations=0``` above).
* *RQ2-Incrementality* The comparison ```iTC vs. bTC``` summarizes the incrementality per Topology Control iteration.
* *RQ3-Performance* The CPU time and the link state modification count is recorded for all major steps of a Topology Control run (e.g., ```t=220ms, t_check=11ms```).
* *RQ4-Generality* This is a research question that is discussed extensively in the paper. Still, the number of implemented Topology Control algorithms indicates the applicability of the approach.

There is also a class that runs the entire evaluation: *JVLCEvaluationExecutor* (search for it via Ctrl+Shift+R)
This class produces files that can then be processed using R:
1. Start the launch configuration *simonstrator-simrunner/config/rkluge/jvlc/Rconsole.launch*.
2.
